# Desmos CPU

Well god dam, it's a CPU in the hit graphing calculator [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)  
I made this because I got bored, don't expect much  
Use `assembler.py` to assemble programs to run on it  
Here's a [link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xeyxrjpod5) to the actual project  
If it doesn't work, make a formal complaint
